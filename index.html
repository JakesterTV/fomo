				i always wonder why birds choose to stay in<br>
				the same place when they could fly<br>
				anywhere on earth<br>
				- i then ask myself the same<br>
				i think it doesnt matter if youre aware of it<br>
				or not<br>
				how tidal everything seems<br>
				that one day you might stand on paradise<br>
				not move and soon be drowning<br>
				or how some things you left behind<br>
				wait for you in your hotel room, some place<br>
				for latent change<br>
				to be reclimbed, reassembled<br>
				and unknotted<br>
				for me to say anything i must first have <br>
				listened<br>
				for you to find anything you have to look<br>
				even in some small way<br>
				As above so below<br>
				the blue, the blue, and blue<br>
				running, tripping, falling

				it was kind of like waking up from dream<br>
				those lifelike episodes<br>
				you second guess yourself wondering<br> 
				if any of it actually happened<br>
				The last forever in third person<br>
				A chase cam rolling with the current<br>
				Pushed, moved, <br>
				and pulled out of view<br>
				and ive been thinking about a change of<br> 
				pace<br>
				or the pace of change<br>
				or how the last few years were a singularity<br> 
				you were the universe folding in on itself<br>
				information bleeds<br>
				no name<br>
				no location<br>
				no frame of reference<br>
				running, tripping, falling<br>
				unsure of what it was i turned around and<br>
				carried on
